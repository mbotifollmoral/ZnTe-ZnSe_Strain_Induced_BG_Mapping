Data and code for the paper: Sub-nanometer mapping of strain-induced band structure variations in planar nanowire core-shell heterostructures 
INSERT CITATION:

This repository contains all the data (both raw and processed) used in the research paper: Sub-nanometer mapping of strain-induced band structure variations in planar nanowire core-shell heterostructures.

In addition, the repository contains all the necessary code for reproducing, from the very raw data, all the results displayed in the paper, towards the best sake of reproducibility. 
While the process is greatly tailored to the presented system of study (ZnSe@ZnTe core-shell nanowires on A2O3 substrate) and so is the code for achieving it, its core and guidance is perfectly applicable for any translational invariant nanostructure, as detailed in the paper.
